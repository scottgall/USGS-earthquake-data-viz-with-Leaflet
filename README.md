# Mapping earthquake data with Leaflet üó∫Ô∏è

* This interactive map uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) to retrieve and plot the last month's earthquake recordings from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/). 

* The color of each plot reflects the earthquake's depth and the size reflects it's magnitude.

* Additionally, tectonic plate boundaries are represented on the map using [GeoJSON data](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).
